        Nature is full of simple but amazing facts. The Earth moves around the Sun once every year, and this movement is what creates the seasons. Water is essential for all living things, and it covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface. Trees help clean the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, which humans and animals need to breathe.</p>


     <h1 >Plants</h1>
    <p class="p2">

        Plants and animals depend on each other in many ways. Trees provide oxygen and help keep the air clean, while animals help spread seeds and keep ecosystems balanced.<br> Mountains, forests, and deserts were formed over millions of years through natural processes.<br> Even small changes in nature can have a big impact on life on Earth.
